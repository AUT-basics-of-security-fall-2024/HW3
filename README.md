# Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange with HMAC Authentication üõ°Ô∏è  

This project is part of **Homework 3 (HW3)** for the **Information Security course** at **Amirkabir University of Technology**. It demonstrates how to implement **Diffie-Hellman key exchange** and use **HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)** to ensure message integrity and authenticity.

---

## Features
- **Secure Key Exchange:** Generates a shared secret key without directly transmitting private keys.
- **Message Authentication:** Uses HMAC to ensure the integrity and authenticity of messages.
- **SHA-256 Hash Function:** Implements SHA-256 as the hashing algorithm for HMAC.
- **Interactive Notebook:** A step-by-step Jupyter Notebook with detailed explanations.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **cryptography** library  

To install the required library, run:
```bash
pip install cryptography
