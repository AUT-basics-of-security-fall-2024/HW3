Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange with HMAC Authentication üõ°Ô∏è
This project is part of Homework 3 (HW3) for the Information Security course at Amirkabir University of Technology. It demonstrates the practical implementation of secure key exchange using Diffie-Hellman and message authentication with HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) to ensure message integrity and authenticity.

Features
Secure Key Exchange: Uses Diffie-Hellman to generate a shared secret key without direct transmission of private keys.
Message Authentication: Implements HMAC with SHA-256 to verify the integrity and authenticity of exchanged messages.
Step-by-Step Notebook: Interactive Jupyter Notebook with detailed explanations for each step.
Real-World Cryptography: Demonstrates essential cryptographic techniques used in secure communications.
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+
Jupyter Notebook
cryptography library
To install the required library:

pip install cryptography
How to Run the Notebook
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/srvn-nm/diffie-hellman-hmac.git
cd diffie-hellman-hmac
Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook
Open the diffie_hellman_hmac.ipynb notebook.

Follow the Instructions:
Run each cell sequentially and follow the explanations to understand the key exchange process and HMAC calculation.

Expected Output
The notebook walks through the process of:

Generating a shared key using Diffie-Hellman.
Computing the HMAC of a message to ensure its integrity and authenticity.
Verifying consistency between the keys and HMAC values.
Example Output:

Shared Key: [A numerical value]
HMAC: [A hexadecimal hash value]

How to Verify the Results
Check Shared Key Consistency: Ensure both parties derive the same shared key.
Validate HMAC Calculation: Use the provided shared key and message to confirm that the generated HMAC matches the expected value.
